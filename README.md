# 📍 Mapping of State-wise Sex Ratio in India (1961 - 2011)

A GIS-based project analyzing and visualizing the state-wise sex ratio trends in India from 1961 to 2011 using **Quantum GIS (QGIS)**. This project highlights regional disparities and demographic patterns across six decades, enabling better understanding through spatial data visualization.

---

## 🗺️ Project Overview

This project presents a comprehensive, spatially visualized analysis of the **sex ratio** (number of females per 1,000 males) across Indian states and union territories from **1961 to 2011**. The study leverages **QGIS** technology to create thematic maps that represent temporal and regional trends in gender balance.

### Key Highlights:
- Analysis based on **Census of India** data from 1961 to 2011.
- Visualization through **QGIS** mapping.
- Focus on state-wise disparities and historical trends in sex ratio.
- Exploration of socio-economic and policy factors influencing gender balance.

---

## 📚 Project Objective

The primary objective of this project is to **map the sex ratio in India, state-wise, from 1961 to 2011**. The project aims to:
- Visualize trends and disparities in the sex ratio over time.
- Identify regions with critical gender imbalances.
- Highlight socio-economic and policy factors influencing the sex ratio.

## 🗃️ Data & Methodology

1. **Data Collection**:
   - Sex ratio statistics were collected from official **Census of India** data for 28 states and 7 union territories.
   - Shapefiles of India’s administrative boundaries were sourced from **Diva-GIS**.

2. **Data Processing**:
   - Data was compiled and cleaned using **MS Excel**.
   - The shapefile was prepared in **QGIS** for thematic mapping.

3. **Mapping**:
   - The sex ratio data was joined with spatial data in QGIS.
   - **Equal Interval Symbology** was applied to classify and visualize the sex ratio in various years.
   - Thematic maps were created for the census years: 1961, 1971, 1981, 1991, 2001, and 2011.

4. **Visualization & Interpretation**:
   - Maps were analyzed to study temporal and spatial trends.
   - Interpretation of patterns was correlated with socio-economic factors and government policies.

## 📝 Results & Discussion

- The maps reveal **regional disparities** in the sex ratio across different decades.
- States like **Kerala** and **Manipur** consistently show a higher sex ratio, reflecting better gender parity.
- Northern states like **Haryana** and **Punjab** exhibit persistently lower sex ratios, often attributed to socio-cultural factors.
- Improvement in certain regions suggests the **positive impact** of interventions like the **PCPNDT Act (1994)** and **Beti Bachao Beti Padhao** campaigns.

---

## 📌 Key Findings

- **Kerala** shows a positive trajectory, with a sex ratio rising from 1,022 (1961) to 1,084 (2011).
- **Haryana** and **Punjab** remain at the lower end but show slight improvements by 2011.
- Southern and northeastern regions demonstrate better gender parity compared to the northern plains.

---

## 🔎 Future Scope

- Extending analysis to **district-level sex ratio data** for finer granularity.
- Incorporating **Child Sex Ratio (CSR)** analysis for more targeted interventions.
- Integrating **socio-economic indicators** (literacy rates, health indices) with sex ratio mapping.
